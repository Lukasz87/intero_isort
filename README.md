# Isort intero

This is a plugin for [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) that enforces import order following the coding guidelines in the [Odoo documentation](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/contributing/development/coding_guidelines.html#imports).

## How to Use

### Manually

1. **Install:**
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/Lukasz87/intero_isort
    ```
   
2. **Add the Configuration from Configuration section**

3. **Run file checking:**
    ```bash
    isort <path-to-file>/file_to_check.py
    ```

### Automatically - Using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):

1. **Add to `pre-commit-config.yaml`:**
    ```yaml
    - repo: https://github.com/Lukasz87/intero_isort
      rev: v1.0
      hooks:
        - id: isort
          args: ["--profile", "black", "--filter-files"]
    ```

   Repo (`repo`) URL and revision (`rev`) should be updated with the URL and version where you will be hosting the package, or you can use the provided ones.

2. **Add the Configuration from Configuration section**

## Configuration
Add `.isort.cfg` in the main folder of your repository with values:


```cfg
[settings]
known_odoo=odoo
known_odooaddons = odoo.addons
default_section=THIRDPARTY
sections=THIRDPARTY,ODOO,ODOO_ADDONS
multi_line_output=3
sort_order=intero
line_length=79
```

## Optionally - Package Modification

You can also put configuration directly to package in file `pyproject.toml` in the section
`[tool.isort]` ( but you need to reinstall the package after it).
Unfortunately, in my environment, I have a problem that **ODOOADDONS** don't sort, so the best way is to use `.isort.cfg.`
:
```toml
[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
known_odooaddons = "odoo.addons"
known_odoo = "odoo"
default_section = "THIRDPARTY"
sections = ["THIRDPARTY", "ODOO", "ODOOADDONS"]
multi_line_output = 3
sort_order = "intero"
line_length = 79
```
